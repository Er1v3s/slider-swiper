## Live preview - **https://er1v3s.github.io/slider-swiper**

# Simple Vanilla JavaScript slider-swiper project

**_Slider_** is created using functional methodology of creating applications

**_Swiper_** is created using OOP methodology

Of course it could be much simpler, but this app is created for my practising and showing skills of both methodology :)

One more thing... functionality of this white circles below images is implemented in slider, so you won't see theirs deleting slider.js file

It correctly bundles files in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
